This google chrome extension add the HTML-elements content to the session storage, you do so by holding the "c" button down and clicking on the HTML-text-element you want added to the storage. 
You can display the stored content inside the extension popup by clicking the "get data" button and finally if you click the table area you copy the text.

I built this to help me in my process for collecting text content on websites. 

When you have copied it you have the option to paste it wherever you like.
